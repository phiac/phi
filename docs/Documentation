Documentation for Machine Learning App Using Markov Decision Process (MDP)

This document serves as a reference for understanding and implementing a machine learning app that uses Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). It includes definitions, best practices, and a README file for web deployment.
Definitions
Markov Decision Process (MDP)

An MDP is a mathematical framework used to model decision-making problems where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision-making agent. It is defined by the tuple:
MDP=(S,A,P,R,γ)
MDP=(S,A,P,R,γ)

    SS: A set of possible states the agent can be in.

    AA: A set of possible actions the agent can take.

    P(s′∣s,a)P(s′∣s,a): The transition probability of moving from state ss to state s′s′ after taking action aa.

    R(s,a)R(s,a): The reward received for taking action aa in state ss.

    γγ: The discount factor that determines how much future rewards are valued compared to immediate rewards (0≤γ≤10≤γ≤1).

Markov Property

The Markov Property states that the next state depends only on the current state and action, not on the sequence of previous states. This simplifies decision-making by focusing only on the present.
Policy (ππ)

A policy is a mapping from states to actions. It defines what action an agent should take in each state to maximize cumulative rewards.
Value Function (V(s)V(s))

The value function represents the expected cumulative reward starting from state ss and following a specific policy.
Q-Value Function (Q(s,a)Q(s,a))

The Q-value function represents the expected cumulative reward starting from state ss, taking action aa, and following a specific policy thereafter.
Best Practices
1. Define MDP Components Clearly

    Clearly define all states (SS), actions (AA), transition probabilities (PP), rewards (RR), and the discount factor (γγ).

    Ensure that transition probabilities sum to 1 for each state-action pair.

2. Validate Input Data

    Validate that transition_probabilities and rewards have consistent dimensions:

        transition_probabilities: [num_states][num_actions][num_states]

        rewards: [num_states][num_actions][num_states]

    Use helper functions to debug and validate data before running algorithms.

3. Use Value Iteration or Policy Iteration

    Implement value iteration or policy iteration algorithms to compute optimal policies.

    Use dynamic programming techniques to improve computational efficiency.

4. Optimize Discount Factor (γγ)

    Choose γγ based on the problem:

        High γγ (close to 1): Long-term rewards are prioritized.

        Low γγ (close to 0): Immediate rewards are prioritized.

5. Handle Edge Cases

    Ensure proper handling of terminal states (states with no further transitions).

    Avoid invalid inputs by adding error handling and validation checks.

6. Visualize Results

    Visualize policies and value functions using graphs or heatmaps for better interpretability.

    Provide clear output for policies (e.g., mapping states to actions).
